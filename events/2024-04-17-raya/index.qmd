> ![](PHOTO-2024-04-03-13-13-54.jpg)Join us for an engaging afternoon dedicated to the exploration and discussion of R, hosted against the backdrop of the festive season of Hari Raya Aidilfitri. While the occasion gives us a wonderful reason to gather, our focus will be on the fascinating world of R programming. This meetup is the perfect opportunity to connect with fellow R users, gain insights from their experiences, and share your own in a casual and friendly environment. Not to mention, bubble tea will be served!

Whether you are a beginner or an experienced R user, this session promises to enhance your understanding of Geographical Information Systems (GIS) data and its applications. Our focus will be on leveraging R for the importation, analysis, and visualization of spatial data (e.g. shapefile data). By integrating these with various study data, such as house price data modelling, disease outbreak mapping, and physicochemical soil data analysis, we unlock new insights and opportunities for innovative research.

This introductory session will serve as your gateway to the essential `R packages` and textbook references needed for effective spatial data analysis. We'll cover a few basic spatial statistical methods, with a special emphasis on Bruneian spatial data, to provide local context and relevance.
