# After-Event Summary: Exploration of Spatial Data Insights with R

We're excited to share the key takeaways from our inaugural event, "Analysing Spatial Data using R," held on March 9, 2024. Led by Dr. Haziq Jamil, Assistant Professor in Statistics at UBD, this event highlighted Geographical Information Systems (GIS) data analysis with R. Let's delve into the highlights:

## Unveiling Spatial Data Fundamentals

Attendees were guided through a comprehensive exploration of spatial data fundamentals, starting with the basics of importing various spatial data formats. Dr. Haziq elucidated the process of harnessing R's capabilities to manipulate and visualize spatial data, paving the way for attendees to uncover valuable insights hidden within geographical datasets.

## Integrating Spatial Analysis Techniques

One of the highlights of the event was the integration of spatial analysis techniques with real-world datasets. Participants learned how to combine spatial data with other types of study data, such as house price data modeling and disease outbreak mapping, demonstrating the versatility and applicability of spatial analysis across diverse domains.
